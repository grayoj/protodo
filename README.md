# Protodo

Built this over the weekend on a Google Meet while showing someone how gRPC and Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) works.

> Unfortunately Vite has an issue resolving the generated .proto files.

I intend to sort out the client side issues. This is essentially a Todo list project to illustrate how the aforemntioned concepts work.

> It's entirely experimental and a WIP!

Built using Go, gRPC, Vite, Sqlite React (Typescript), [Bun]("http://bun.sh") + Tailwindcss. Minimalistic as possible, the goal.
